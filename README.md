# UNDT-Hydrophone
I think this is all the code needed to run the hydrophone with simple example scripts.

# Dependencies
Zaber Console: https://www.zaber.com/software

Zaber Motion Control: https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/install/matlab

TiePie Drivers: https://www.tiepie.com/en/download. "WinUSB Driver"

### Hydrophone 
Installed over USB but may not work without Microsoft .net Framework.

Latest version: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework
version 3.5 might be better.... not sure if they conflict are both needed or just one...
